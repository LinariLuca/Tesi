# üìù Git Repository Analysis Thesis Project

This project was developed as part of a **thesis project** and aims to analyze one or more Git repositories, generating structured data in **JSON** and **CSV** formats.  
The analysis leverages the [PyDriller](https://pydriller.readthedocs.io/) library, a powerful tool for inspecting and mining Git repository history.

## üöÄ Main Features

‚úÖ Automatically extract information from repositories listed in a text file  
‚úÖ Generate JSON files containing data for each analyzed repository  
‚úÖ Aggregate all extracted data into a single CSV output file  
‚úÖ Manage output files in an organized way for further processing  
‚úÖ Control the execution flow to prevent errors due to missing data

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **Estra1.py** ‚Äì Script for extracting data and generating JSON files
- **Ispeziona_git.py** ‚Äì Script for reading the generated JSON files and creating the aggregated CSV file
- **test.txt** ‚Äì File containing the list of Git repository URLs to analyze (one URL per line)
- **JSON Output** ‚Äì Automatically generated by *Estra1.py*
- **CSV Output** ‚Äì Automatically generated by *Ispeziona_git.py*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Make sure you have installed the following components:

- **Python 3.x**
- **PyDriller**

You can install PyDriller using pip: **pip install pydriller**

## üí° How to Run the Project

Follow these simple steps:

1. **Preparation**  
   Add the Git repository URLs you want to analyze into the `test.txt` file, one URL per line.

2. **Extract JSON Data**  
   Run the `Estra1.py` script to start analyzing the repositories.  
   This will generate as many JSON files as there are URLs ==> **python Estra1.py** 

3. **Create the Aggregated CSV File**  
   Run the `Ispeziona_git.py` script, which will read all the previously generated JSON files and produce a single CSV file with consolidated data ==> **python Ispeziona_git.py**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**  
If you run `Ispeziona_git.py` before `Estra1.py`, the program will not work because the JSON files do not exist yet.

## üìå Usage Tips

- Always check that 'test.txt' contains valid and accessible repository URLs.
- Execute the scripts **in the correct order**: first `Estra1.py`, then `Ispeziona_git.py`.
- You can customize the output paths by editing the scripts if needed.

## ‚ú® Possible Future Improvements

1. Improve error handling when downloading repositories (e.g., handling unreachable URLs).
2. Add support for exporting data in other formats (Excel, databases).
3. Create a graphical interface to make the scripts easier to use for non-technical users.
